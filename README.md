Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:is the systematic application of engineering principles ,methodes and to tools to develipemnt and maintamce of high quality softwware systeme 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
software engineering involves developement,design,testing , deployement and maintance of software products. the skills required for software engineers combines computer science principles, engineering practice and project management.software engineers often work and collaborate with teams that work in system achitecture , requirment analysis and project planning.   
While on the other hand tradition programming is the process of writting code to create softeware applications or solvr specific problems , the primary focus here is code writting and making sure that the program works , programmers have technical expertise in coding languages and algorthms.Programmers often work alone.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): -Requirments 
Design
Implementation  
Testing   
Deployement
Maintanace

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirments which involves the gathering of the users need and system requirements from the user (client)
Design the software enginer turn the requirements in to a design by creating a high level and detailed design of software achitecture and user interface
Implementation  now that the design is done it needs to be executed  through writting of code and building the software according to design specifications.
Testing conducting condusting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
Deployment releasing the software to users (Customer)
Monitoring constant support , updates and enhancements of the software for more conviniece and effectiveness after deployement. 


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile is the incremental and iterative  process of fotware development 
Waterfall is the sequential approach, basically is the dowmward flow of information according to its order just the the software developemnt life cycle.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile --allows continuous iteration life cycle developing and testing software incrementally, its process emphasizes faxibility , adaptability and customer satisfaction.Client is continuously involved in the process and feedback is essential, quick delivery. 

Waterfall --Life cycle is linear sequential model which involves distint phases (requirements, design ,implemeentation,testing , deployement)
the process breaks down development into different phases with minimal overlap.making changes after a phase is very difficult and costly, the is minimal client involvement and feedback. Very log delivery time. 


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

This is the process of defining , documenting  and mainatning requirements in the engineering design process.RE outlines what a project should do rather than how it should be done. It is very important fir gathering both functional and non-functional requirement from stakeholders. 
The process involves the below in its order 
Feasibility study assess if project shoulf proceed , eximines technical , economical and legal operational and shedule aspects , reveles potentional benefits and limitations. 
Requirement elicitation ad analysis developers and stakeholders meet to inquire about their needs and wants regarding the softerware product, requirements are identified ,conflicts resolved.
System modeling life cycle modling 
Requirements specifications requirements are documented in a formal artifact called requirements specifications 
Requirements validation  documented requirements and models are consistent and meet stakeholder needs. 



Software Design Principles:


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity software refers to the breaking down  of a complex sysytem to smaller , independenf modules (such functions ,classes or components ) these modules improves the software  in terms of betters code orginization and readability ( dividing a complex system into smaller modules creates logical and structure codebase ) 
Promotes collaboration between team members so that there can be a smooth working environment as each person wrk on specific modules withou conflic 
Code reausability  a well defined modules which can be reused in fifferent project . 
Scalability  which is adding  new features  which does not disruot existing modules. 

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unti testing -Testing of individual componmtse.g methodes  or classes . it focuses on verifying that each unit behaves and its important because it etects early and ensures correctness
Intergratin testing verify interactions between integrated modules or components . 
System testing Validate the enire system as a wholes , verifies end to end functionality, performance , security and compliance. 
Acceptance testing  ensure software meets user requirements 

Testing is important for the following reasons , Quality  ssurace so that defects can be identified and solved  early , for reliabity purposes to ensure an thotoghly testsed software athat operates smoothly with no glitches ,User satisfaction  a well tested software meets user needs and it enhances satisfaction. Lastly testing is important to reduce uncessesory costs which are associated with fixing issues at a later stage. 

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Versin control systems are essential tools in development since they help developers with tracking and managing changes to their code 
They keep a detailed accoount of every modification made to the code , ensuring changes are trackable and reverible and the have benefits such efficient release amangement and tracking chages to digital artfacts beyond source code 
Git-supports branching merging and  conflict resolution 
Mercurual -Efficient for both small and large projects 

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
 A software projest manager leads the development team by ensuring projects are complted on time , within bufget and meet the user satisfaction, reposibilities include risk managemnt , planning, resiurce allocation and effective communication .  challanges are  the unclear expectations , time constraints and changing requirements.  

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance involves regulary enancing software to eliminate bugs , improve performance , and modify features.Types of mainatance are the  corrective maintance , preventive, perfective and adaptive.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical challanges realted to algorithmic bias, personal data collection, weak security protection. and in oder for software engineers to adhere to standards they should consider potential misuse , take accountability and act as responsible citizens. 
Submission Guidelines:

Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
